A node in the ordering service can either have the role of leader or that of follower. There must be only one leader int he entire network and a node with this role is responsible for creating a block from the transactions it receives. Hyperledger Fabric ordering service uses the Raft consensus algorithm to elect a leader between the available nodes.

The remaining nodes have a follower role. If the leader is not reachable, a new leader is selected from the set of remaining nodes. Followers receive messages from the leader in order to have the same state of knowledge as the leader and to be able to replace it if it becomes unavailable.

Here's an improved version of your text with clearer language, corrected typos, and improved structure:

In the ordering service, each node assumes one of two roles: leader or follower. There must be exactly one leader in the entire network at any given time. The leader is responsible for creating blocks from the transactions it receives. Hyperledger Fabric's ordering service utilizes the Raft consensus algorithm to elect a leader among the available nodes.

The remaining nodes function as followers. If the leader becomes unreachable, a new leader is selected from the pool of follower nodes. Followers receive messages from the leader to maintain the same state of knowledge. This synchronization enables a follower to seamlessly take over the leader role if necessary.

help me improve and expand: Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation of a private permissioned distributed ledger. This ensures that all elements of the system (users and nodes) must be authenticated through certificates or other digital means and have the necessary permissions (guarantees the authorization process) assigned to them by ledger administrators. 

Hyperledger Fabric is being supported by several large companies, its code is open, and the solution itself is mature. Through this software, it is possible to quickly create a network using available cloud services. 

Hyperledger Fabric enables the use of chaincodes (smart contracts), which allow you to create your own rules for adding data and reading data stored in the distributed ledger.

The language used to write chaincodes is a common language (it was not developed specifically for use in Hyperledger Fabric). This makes it easier to write chaincodes. Without using chaincodes, users cannot perform any operation on a distributed ledger. Changing the chaincode requires the approval of each organization that is part of that distributed ledger. Hyperledger Fabric is not a specialized distributed ledger, this means that it can be used in any scenario that requires the use of distributed ledgers.

Hyperledger Fabric consists of two services: peer and ordering~\cite{HLF_Docs}. It is not necessary for every Hyperledger Fabric node to have these two services running. The peer service is responsible for executing chaincodes, storing chaincodes, and storing and updating the ledger.

Here’s an improved and expanded version of your text, with more detail, clearer structure, and improved flow:

Hyperledger Fabric is a robust implementation of a private, permissioned distributed ledger. It ensures that all system components, including users and nodes, are authenticated through certificates or other digital means. Additionally, it enforces strict permissions, with authorization processes managed by ledger administrators, ensuring only authorized participants can interact with the network.

Supported by several major companies, Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source and mature solution. Its open codebase allows for transparency and collaboration, while its maturity guarantees stability and reliability for enterprise applications. Leveraging this software, organizations can quickly set up and deploy a blockchain network using available cloud services, significantly reducing time-to-market.

One of Hyperledger Fabric's key features is its support for chaincodes, the equivalent of smart contracts. Chaincodes enable users to define custom rules for adding and retrieving data stored on the distributed ledger. Unlike platforms that rely on proprietary languages, Hyperledger Fabric allows chaincodes to be written in general-purpose programming languages such as Go, Java, and JavaScript. This design choice simplifies development and lowers the barrier to entry for developers familiar with these languages.

Chaincodes are essential for performing any operation on the distributed ledger. Without them, users cannot interact with the ledger. Any modification to an existing chaincode requires consensus and approval from all participating organizations within the network, ensuring collaborative governance. This makes Hyperledger Fabric highly adaptable and suitable for diverse use cases requiring distributed ledgers, rather than being restricted to specialized scenarios.

The architecture of Hyperledger Fabric is centered around two core services: peer nodes and the ordering service. Each node in the network does not necessarily need to host both services, allowing for flexible and optimized deployments. Peer nodes are responsible for executing chaincodes, storing chaincode data, and maintaining an updated ledger. The ordering service, on the other hand, ensures the proper sequencing of transactions and facilitates consensus within the network.

In summary, Hyperledger Fabric stands out as a versatile and enterprise-ready distributed ledger platform. Its emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and collaboration makes it a powerful tool for organizations seeking to harness the potential of blockchain technology in a secure, permissioned environment.

Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like any further adjustments!

Ordering Service and Node Roles
Hyperledger Fabric’s ordering service is a critical component responsible for ensuring the proper sequencing of transactions within the network. In the ordering service, each node assumes one of two roles: leader or follower. There must be exactly one leader in the network at any given time. The leader’s primary responsibility is to create blocks from the transactions it receives.

The ordering service leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to elect a leader among the available nodes. If the leader becomes unreachable, a new leader is dynamically selected from the pool of follower nodes. Follower nodes function by receiving messages from the leader to maintain a synchronized state. This synchronization ensures that a follower is always ready to seamlessly take over the leader role, maintaining network stability and continuity.

Peer and Ordering Services
The architecture of Hyperledger Fabric centers around two core services: peer nodes and the ordering service. Each node in the network does not necessarily need to host both services, allowing for flexible and optimized deployments. Peer nodes are responsible for executing chaincodes, storing chaincode data, and maintaining an updated ledger. The ordering service, as outlined above, ensures the correct sequencing of transactions and facilitates consensus across the network.

This comprehensive version integrates the new details on the ordering service roles while maintaining flow and readability. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like adjusted!

\end{figure*}

The environment contains 13 virtual machines, each with 2 CPU cores, 4 GB memory and 30 GB hard drive. Six of them (Nodes 1 - 6) serve as Hyperledger Fabric nodes.  Each Hyperledger Fabric node has a peer and ordering service installed. They represent 6 different organizations. The transaction endorsement policy requires, in order to add a transaction to the ledger, the approval of min. 4 nodes (majority).The orderer service used the Raft protocol. Each Hyperledger Fabric node has 2 interfaces. One is used for communication between Hyperledger Fabric services, and all statistics are collected from this interface (network 192.168.1.X). The second interface (network 172.16.97.1XX) is used to send transactions to the ledger, send events to the NATS server, and for SSH. We thus obtained the ability to use tcpdump to monitor only communications between Hyperledger Fabric services without the impact of network traffic associated with Hyperledger Fabric node monitoring and SSH communications. The next 6 nodes (API 01-06) have the ability to generate transactions. The last node is a NATS server that collects data on the events of sending a transaction, accepting a transaction, and adding a transaction to a block.

To evaluate the performance of Hyperledger Fabric, we conducted several experiments in a networked environment emulated through EMANE (Extendable Mobile Ad hoc Network Emulator). EMANE was selected for its scalability and flexibility. EMANE is released as open source and is available for download at the GitHub website. The EMANE models we used for the experimentation were the Commeffect and IEEE80211 models.

We selected several scenarios using these EMANE models. The Commeffect utility model allowed us to modify the latency, loss and bandwidth and then, generate the events. The IEEE80211 b/g mix model supports WiFi, flow control and bandwidth capabilities. In this case, we used the Anglova scenario \cite{suri-2016} \cite{suri-2018} to generate pathloss events. This scenario was developed as part of the NATO IST-124 RTG and released as open source data. This scenario incorporates an emulation of an SCB (Synchronized Cooperative Broadcast) radio model \cite{marcus-2020} to measure the effectiveness of data dissemination over the emulated SCB waveform. We used a phase of the Anglova scenario from 0 to 2000 seconds.

In each experiment, we changed the number of transactions per second, size, duration and delay of the message sent by the application. We also collected the tcpdump files to evaluate the traffic generated.

The experiments are summarized in Table \ref{tab:experiment-summary}

Research Environment Overview
Figure \ref{fig:architecture} presents the architecture of our research environment, which consists of thirteen virtual machines. Each virtual machine is configured with 2 CPU cores, 4 GB of memory, and a 30 GB hard drive. Six of these machines, referred to as Nodes 1 through 6, serve as Hyperledger Fabric nodes. Each of these nodes has both peer and ordering services installed and represents a distinct organization. The transaction endorsement policy requires the approval of at least four nodes—a majority—for a transaction to be added to the ledger. The ordering service relies on the Raft protocol to ensure consensus.

Each Hyperledger Fabric node is equipped with two network interfaces. The first interface, assigned to the 192.168.1.X network, handles communication between Hyperledger Fabric services. All statistics and network traffic related to these interactions are collected from this interface using tcpdump. The second interface, assigned to the 172.16.97.1XX network, manages transactions sent to the ledger, events sent to the NATS server, and SSH communications. By separating these functions across two interfaces, we were able to monitor communications between Hyperledger Fabric services without interference from traffic related to monitoring and SSH.

The remaining six virtual machines, labeled API01 through API06, generate transactions for the system. The final virtual machine is a NATS server, which collects event data such as transaction submission, acceptance, and block addition.

Experimentation Setup
The performance of Hyperledger Fabric was evaluated in a networked environment emulated using the Extendable Mobile Ad hoc Network Emulator (EMANE). EMANE was selected due to its scalability, flexibility, and availability as an open-source tool on GitHub. The emulator allowed us to test the system under realistic conditions while customizing network parameters.

Two EMANE models were employed during the experiments. The Commeffect utility model allowed us to modify latency, loss, and bandwidth, enabling the generation of network events under controlled conditions. The IEEE80211 b/g mix model provided WiFi simulation capabilities, including flow control and bandwidth management. For these experiments, we utilized the Anglova scenario, a dataset developed as part of the NATO IST-124 RTG and available as open-source data. This scenario emulates an SCB (Synchronized Cooperative Broadcast) radio model to assess data dissemination over the SCB waveform. The experiment was conducted over a phase of the Anglova scenario lasting from 0 to 2000 seconds, during which path loss events were generated.

Experiment Details
The experiments involved altering variables such as the number of transactions per second, transaction size, message duration, and delay. Data traffic generated by the experiments was captured using tcpdump for further analysis. The experiments were designed to provide insights into the behavior of the Hyperledger Fabric network under different configurations and network conditions. A summary of the experiments is presented in Table \ref{tab:experiment-summary}.

maintain figures help me write better: Figures \ref{fig:e1-aggregate}, \ref{fig:e2-aggregate}, and \ref{fig:e3-aggregate}, show the result of the first three experiments where six nodes are connected using Hyperledger Fabric. In these experiments, no Commefects were applied to the connections. Node 1 was configured to generate traffic at a rate of 1 message per second, with message sizes of 100 bytes, 500 bytes, and 1 kilobyte for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 

The primary objective of this set of experiments was to evaluate the throughput growth as the messages' size increase.

Fig. \ref{fig:e1-aggregate} shows the input / output traffic of Node 1, 2 and 5. While Node 1 is responsible for generating all the traffic, Node 5 exhibits the highest traffic activity towards other nodes as it was elected leader of the group. It is worth noting that the bandwidth consumption is significantly higher than what is required to add new messages to the ledger. This behavior is consistent across all the experiments.

During the 1 minute duration of the experiment, the highest-throughput nodes achieved average send/receive rates of 54/20 KBps, 72/22 KBps and 81/22 KBps for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The expected bandwidth for transmitting 60 messages should only amount to 24 KB (calculated as 100 bytes/message x 60 messages × 5 replica nodes), 240 KB and 2400 KB for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The observed bandwidth consumption is considerably higher due to the overhead associated with maintaining the Hyperledger Fabric infrastructure. This inefficiency is likely attributable to suboptimal design choices and the reliance on unicast communication. 

In the fourth experiment, we increased the speed of generation of messages to 10 per second, we can compare this to the first experiment since both experiments generate messages of 100 bytes.

Here’s an improved and more concise version of the text with better readability while retaining the figures:

Figures \ref{fig:e1-aggregate}, \ref{fig:e2-aggregate}, and \ref{fig:e3-aggregate} present the results of the first three experiments, where six nodes were connected using Hyperledger Fabric. In these experiments, no Commeffect alterations were applied to the network connections. Node 1 was configured to generate traffic at a rate of one message per second, with message sizes set to 100 bytes, 500 bytes, and 1 kilobyte for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The primary goal of these experiments was to evaluate how throughput scales as message size increases.

Figure \ref{fig:e1-aggregate} illustrates the input and output traffic for Nodes 1, 2, and 5. Node 1, being the source of all generated traffic, exhibits consistent activity. Notably, Node 5 shows the highest traffic among all nodes as it was elected the leader of the group. This leadership role results in elevated communication activity with other nodes. Across all experiments, the bandwidth consumption observed is significantly higher than the theoretical requirement for adding messages to the ledger.

Over the one-minute experiment duration, the highest-throughput nodes achieved average send/receive rates of 54/20 KBps, 72/22 KBps, and 81/22 KBps for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In contrast, the expected bandwidth for transmitting 60 messages should amount to 24 KB (calculated as 
100

messages
×
5
 
replica nodes
100bytes/message×60messages×5replica nodes), 240 KB, and 2400 KB for experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The discrepancy between observed and expected bandwidth usage is primarily due to the overhead associated with maintaining the Hyperledger Fabric infrastructure. This inefficiency is likely a result of suboptimal design choices and the use of unicast communication protocols.

In the fourth experiment, the message generation rate was increased to 10 messages per second, while maintaining a message size of 100 bytes. This configuration provides a direct comparison to the first experiment, enabling an analysis of the impact of increased message generation speed.

A significant spike is created when Node 5 joins the fabric at instant 22:18:50. Upon connecting Node 5, Node 1 exchanges more than 6MB, ideally, less than 30KB should be necessary (30 messages X 100 bytes X 5 nodes) in the whole experiment. With two late connections, the total traffic exchanged by the nodes becomes 48MB, again significantly higher than what would be optimally necessary.

These figures highlight that the reconnecting node introduces a significant traffic spike, overshadowing the effects of latency and packet loss on the network.

Experiment 19, conducted without packet loss or latency, provides a contrasting perspective. As shown in Figures \ref{fig:e17-aggregate}, \ref{fig:e18-aggregate}, \ref{fig:e19-aggregate}, \ref{fig:e19-sent-received-aggregate}, and \ref{fig:e19-aggregate-2}, the throughput increase observed in Experiment 19 differs from Experiments 17 and 18.

Below is an example implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in Java. This algorithm computes the shortest paths from a source vertex to all vertices in a weighted graph, even when negative weight edges are present (as long as there are no negative weight cycles).

Java Implementation of Bellman-Ford Algorithm
import java.util.Arrays;

class BellmanFord {
    // Edge class to represent a graph edge
    static class Edge {
        int source, destination, weight;

        Edge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
            this.source = source;
            this.destination = destination;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    // Bellman-Ford algorithm
    public void bellmanFord(int vertices, int edges, Edge[] edgeList, int source) {
        // Step 1: Initialize distances from source to all vertices as infinite
        int[] distance = new int[vertices];
        Arrays.fill(distance, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distance[source] = 0;

        // Step 2: Relax all edges |V| - 1 times
        for (int i = 1; i < vertices; i++) {
            for (Edge edge : edgeList) {
                if (distance[edge.source] != Integer.MAX_VALUE 
                        && distance[edge.source] + edge.weight < distance[edge.destination]) {
                    distance[edge.destination] = distance[edge.source] + edge.weight;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Check for negative weight cycles
        for (Edge edge : edgeList) {
            if (distance[edge.source] != Integer.MAX_VALUE 
                    && distance[edge.source] + edge.weight < distance[edge.destination]) {
                System.out.println("Graph contains a negative weight cycle");
                return;
            }
        }

        // Print results

    private void printSolution(int[] distance) {
        System.out.println("Vertex\tDistance from Source");
        for (int i = 0; i < distance.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(i + "\t" + distance[i]);
        }
    }

    // Driver method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int vertices = 5; // Number of vertices
        int edges = 8;    // Number of edges

        Edge[] edgeList = new Edge[edges];

        // Adding edges to the graph
        edgeList[0] = new Edge(0, 1, -1);
        edgeList[1] = new Edge(0, 2, 4);
        edgeList[2] = new Edge(1, 2, 3);
        edgeList[3] = new Edge(1, 3, 2);
        edgeList[4] = new Edge(1, 4, 2);
        edgeList[5] = new Edge(3, 2, 5);
        edgeList[6] = new Edge(3, 1, 1);
        edgeList[7] = new Edge(4, 3, -3);

        BellmanFord bf = new BellmanFord();
        bf.bellmanFord(vertices, edges, edgeList, 0); // Source vertex is 0
    }
}
Explanation of the Code
Edge Class:

Represents an edge in the graph with source, destination, and weight.
Initialization:

The distance array stores the shortest distance from the source to each vertex.
Initially, all distances are set to Integer.MAX_VALUE (infinity), except for the source vertex which is set to 0.
Relaxation:

The algorithm iterates |V| - 1 times (where V is the number of vertices).
For each edge, it checks if the current distance can be improved by using the edge.
Negative Weight Cycle Check:

A final pass through the edges detects if any distance can still be updated, indicating the presence of a negative weight cycle.
Output:

Prints the shortest distance from the source to all vertices.
Sample Output
For the input provided in the example:

Vertex	Distance from Source
0	0
1	-1
2	2
3	-2
4	1
This output shows the shortest path distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices.
